on_every_line:
The function returns False immediately after checking the first line instead of continuing to check all lines.
on_line should reset inside the loop only if a match isn't found, but the reset is unnecessary.

most_common_word:
common_dict[word] += 2 incorrectly increments the count by 2 instead of 1.
The comparison common_dict[word] >= max_apperances should be >, or else it could incorrectly favor later words in case of a tie.

sum_of_each_row:
The function multiplies each row's sum by 2 before appending it to sum_list, which alters the expected results.
[col][row] instead of [row][col]

smallest_each:
The condition elif pair[1] > smallest_dict[pair[0]]: should be < to find the smallest value instead of the largest.
The final return statement unnecessarily reverses the list.

what_ranking:
The function extracts the ranking from parts[-1], which could be incorrect; it should be parts[0] instead.
if len(parts) < 1

largest_on_each_row:
The function multiplies each largest value by 2 before appending it to largest_list, leading to incorrect results.
Wrong indentation for largest_list
